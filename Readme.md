## Reflection Questions
1. How did using Figma designs as references affect your coding your coding process?

  Using Figma designs as references was incredibly helpful in sereval ways: 

+ Clear Visual Guidance: Figma provided a precise visual blue print for the layout, spacing, fonts,and colors, which made it easier to trenslate the design into code accuratley. 
+ Improved attention to detail and efficient workflow:By matching elements like margins, padding, font sizes and image dimensions with Figma designs, i could be more detail oriented. having all design specification in one place made developemnt process smoother. I could reference the exact value(color codes, spacing in pxels). it eliminatesguest work and makes workflow alot more efficient.

2. What challenges s did you encouter when aligning code to the design specification?

  + Ensuring that images like the avatar sclaled correctly and centered or aligned as intented, was challenging  especially across diffrent screen widths. i have to experiment with max-width and container sizing.
  + One of the main challenges was acheiving the pixel spacing and alignment to match the Figma design.Small differences in padding, margin, or font sizes could make the layout feel "off" so i had to constantly tweak values and inspect elements to try and match the design precisely.

3. How can the feedback and community resources on Frontend Mentor help you improveas a developer?
   
+ when you submit a solution, you can recive destailed, constructive comments from other dvelopers and this will help identify areas that might have been missed or overlooked. 
+ The ability to compare other developer's  solutions to the same challenge will help discover new methods, such as better use of semantic elements, better class naming, or more efficient Flexbox/Grid usage.
+ Its encouraging to know that i can as questions, sahre progess and seek help throuhg community support.
